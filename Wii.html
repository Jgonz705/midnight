                        <div class="col-8 fs-5 text-light"> #1 Open your Wii console - If your Wii console doesn't want to read discs, and you've ruled
                            out that it's not a bad game disc.  it's likely that there is an issue relating to the disc tray of the Wii.
                            In order to check, grab a tri-wing screwdriver and open your Wii console. Make sure to locate the hidden screws located under the grips of the Wii.
                            Once the Wii is open, the front portion that would normally give off a blue light when inserting a disc as well as eating the disc may be disconnected.
                            If so, just simply connect it back into the motherboard nearby, if not just set it aside and peer into the exposed disc tray. Remove any unwanted
                            stuff inside and put the wii back together and test again.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; #2 Replace the optical drive - If you've exhausted the first solution and have absolutely made certain
                            that it isn't a game disc then it's likely that the optical drive that reads the disc is busted all-together. Given this is likely the issue, the easiest
                            solution would be too replace the optical drive of your Wii with that of another as you could find a Wii for relatively cheap. Once you've obtained
                            your optical drive from another Wii or through other means of replacement, simply follow the same steps to #1 and open the wii. Once opened, you 
                            must locate the wire that connects from the non-working optical drive that's connectecting to the motherboard and pull it away. Then place your optical
                            drive where the old one was and connect it into the Wii's motherboard.

                                likely relates to the battery compartment. First, remove the batteries from the Wii and inspect the terminals in which you would place the batteries between.
                                Are the terminals slightly not aligned? gradually apply force with some plastic tweezers or other tool you can grab the terminals with and see if it snaps into place.
                                If the terminals are aligned yet will not read the battery, it's likely an issue of corrosion, you are able to remove the terminals through a small gap left on the sides
                            of it in which you may stick a toothpick or possibly your finger to force the terminal out the top. Once you've got the terminals out, you may grab a small container and fill it 
                        with white vinegar. Now simply just drop the terminal in the white vinegar and let it rest for 15 minutes; it should elimate the corrosion. Once done, place
                        terminals back in the controller the same way you removed them.  </div>
